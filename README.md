## Why Does this exist?

The reasons this addon eixsts are:

  1. To prove to other people you're rich enough to throw away money on useless
     software if you wanted to.

  2. To remind large companies that they cannot control who-to or how I sell my
     own copyrighted work without a contract with me.

Blizzard is welcome to prevent their own users from running code I wrote in
their games. There's a certain kind of evil in attempting to control what other
people can write and this is my "up yours" at the notion.

Even in that copyright backwater of the USA, the use of an API is not protected
by trademark or patent law. What is protected is the implimentation which I am
not reproducing.

Likewise, you're welcome to make your own "I am rich" addon that does exactly
the same thing: I made this one in < 5 minutes. What you're not allowed to do
it redistribute my implementation without explicit permission as it is protected
by my copyrightright.


## License
All rights reserved. Thsi might be open source, but that doesn't mean it's free
software. Distribution without explicit written permission is prohibited. A
license to use this addon can be purchased for $500 USD, contact me via Github
to arrange a purchase.
